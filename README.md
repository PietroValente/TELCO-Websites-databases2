## Overview

A telco company offers pre-paid online services to web users. Two client applications using the same database need to be developed:

- **TelcoEmployeeWEB:**
- **TelcoConsumerWEB:**
- **TelcoEJB:**

The architecture uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) logical subdivision which involves the use of servlets in the WEB parts that interface with the bean (EJB side) to access the database.

The part concerning the EJB was entirely developed using the concepts of Java Persistence API (JPA), thanks to the tool EclipseLink that made this possible.

On database side, triggers have been implemented that automatically fill tables that hold sales data (which are shown in a TelcoEmployeeWEB section).
